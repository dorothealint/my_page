    <introduction>My Dear Friend</introduction>
    <paragraph n="1">I recieved your kind letter yesterday if silence is expressive of ones deep
        feeling then in this way I must ask you to recieve the emotions of what my heart *and pen*
        cannot express hoping the time is not far distant when we may see each other but I must tell
        you what I am trying to accomplish having seen the notice in the paper of <person
            gender="female">Mrs Stowe</person> intention to visit <place type="country"
            location="Europe">England</place> I felt there would not be much hope of coming before
        her for some time and I thought if I could get her to take <person gender="female"
            >Louisa</person> with her she might get interested enough if she could do nothing
        herself she might help <person gender="female">Louisa</person> to do something besides I
        thought <person gender="female">Louisa</person> would be a very good representative of a
            <occupation what="slave" where="south">Southern Slave</occupation> she has improved
        much in her studies and I think that she has energy enough to do something for the cause she
        only needs to to be put in the field I told my Ideas to <person gender="female">Mrs
            Willis</person> she thought they were good and offered to write <person gender="female"
            >Mrs Stowe</person> she wrote last <weekday>Tuesday</weekday> asking her protection and
        if she would place her in some <political_stance>Antislavery</political_stance> family
        unless her services could be useful to her which I would perfer myself intending to pay her
        expenses there the letter was directed as yours when it is answered you shall know dear
            <person gender="female">Amy</person> since I haveno fear of my name coming before those
        whom I have lived in dread of I can not be happy without trying to be useful in some way I
        had a kind note from dear <person gender="female">Sarah</person> saying that she would be in
            <place type="state" location="USA">New york</place> on the 20*th* and wished
        to know our <address>street and number</address> I am going down to see her and <person
            gender="female">Mrs Bush</person> and if <person gender="female">Mrs B</person> do not
        sail on the 20*th* will you drop me a line to let me know I send an answer to
            <person gender="female">Sarah</person> to day also as she will not be there unless
            <person gender="female">Mrs B</person> sails I shall be more than glad to see you
        all</paragraph>
